Î¦ Radiant (Luminous) Power or Flux
: Units are W (or lumens, lm)

I Radiant (Luminous) Intensity
: I = Power / Solid Angle

M Radiant (Luminous) Emittance or Exitance
: M = Power/ Unit Area of a source

E Irradiance (Illuminance)
: Same as M, but for a receiving area. 

L Radiance (Luminance)
: Characterizes a source.

# Problem Set 7: Fields

1. Write down (a) the electric field and (b) the magnetic field vector in
   phasor form for a plane wave with frequency 2.4 GHz, propagating in the
   $\hat{x}+\hat{y}$ direction, linearly polarized in the z direction, and with
   an irradiance of $2 W/m^2$.

2. DIRECTV uses the Ka frequency band (26.5 GHz – 40 GHz).  It uses an off-axis
   parabolic dish with a circular diameter of 0.5m (see {numref}`directv-fig`).

   {numref}`satelliteplane-fig` shows that the source plane is defined as a
   plane perpendicular to the propagation direction.  If the total power of the
   beam is 1W and the shape of the beam is a cosine with zero electric field at
   the edge of 0.5m diameter dish, what is the peak irradiance?

   direction.

3. If the electric field at a square aperture is given by $\psi \left( x,y,z =
   0^- \right) = 5 \exp{\left(-\frac{x^2+y^2}{10}\right)}$ and the aperture has
   a width of 20, what is the electric field at the position (5,7,10)? Set up
   the integral but don’t solve it. Use the diffraction integral $\psi \left(
   P_o \right) = \frac{z}{i\lambda} \int{ \int \psi \left( P_1 \right)
   \frac{\exp \left( ikr \right) }{r^2} dS}$.

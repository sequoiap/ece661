# Problem Set 1: Geometrical Optics

1. Start with the general form of the electric field $\vec{E} = \vec{E}_0 \exp
   (-j k \phi)$, where $\vec{E}$, $E_0$, and $\phi$ all vary with position.
   Show that with the geometrical optics approximation $(\lambda \to 0, k \to
   \infty)$ Gaussâ€™s law becomes $(\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = 0)$.

2. A lifeguard is standing at the point A $(0, 0)$ and a person is drowning at
   the point B $(x_0, y_0)$.  The lifeguard has a running speed of $v_1$ and
   swimming speed of $v_2$ $(v_1 \gt v_2)$. What is the quickest path for the
   lifeguard to take?

3. Book Problem 1.7

4. Book Problem 2.1

5. Book Problem 2.2 (use $c_1 = 1.4$)

6. Book Problem 2.4

7. A ray is incident onto a 45-45-90 prism at an angle of $20^\circ$ (see Figure 2). If the
   two legs are mirror coated, what is the direction of the beam after passing
   through the prism?

   a. What is the ratio of the beam sizes ($W_2 / W_1$)?  

   b. A collimated beam has an elliptical cross section, with a semiaxis ratio
   of 2:1.  Design a prism system that can transform the beam to be circular.

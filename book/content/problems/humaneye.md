# Problem Set 5: The Human Eye

1. The [COOLPIX
   L22](http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product-Archive/Compact-Digital-Cameras/26198/COOLPIX-L22.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-TechSpecs)
   has a pixel width of $1.54 \mu m$, and a focal length of $7.1 mm$.  If the camera is
   focused on an object 30cm away from the camera, what is the depth of field?

2. Calculate the effective focal length and the principal planes for the
   following human eye models. Draw a picture of each eye model with the
   effective focal lengths and principal planes labeled.  The specifics of the
   eye models are given in M. DeAlmeida and L. Carvalho, “Different schematic
   eyes and their accuracy to the in vivo eye: A quantitative comparison
   study,” Brazilian Journal of Physics, vol. 37, P. 378-387, June 2007

      <li>Helmohltz-Laurance Schematic Eye</li>
      <li>Gullstrand’s Schematic Eye</li>
      <li>Emsley Schematic Eye</li>
   </ol>

3. A person has a far point of 50 cm and a near point of 15 cm.

   <ol type="a">
      <li>Is the eye emmetropic, hyperopic, or myopic?</li>
      <li>In more common terms is the person near sighted, or far sighted?</li>
      <li>What power eyeglasses are needed to correct the vision?</li>
      <li>What is the accommodation of this person?</li>
      <li>What is the near point of this person using the glasses?</li>
   </ol>

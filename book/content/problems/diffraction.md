# Problem Set 8: Diffraction

1. A plane wave of intensity $10 mW/cm^2$ and wavelength $\lambda = 600nm$ is
   incident onto a rectangular slit of dimensions 1mm X 0.2mm. Create a
   normalized plot of the diffracted beam 1mm away from the slit.

2. A plane wave of intensity $10 mW/cm^2$ and wavelength $\lambda = 600nm$ is
   incident onto a rectangular slit of dimensions 1mm X 0.2mm. Create a
   normalized plot of the diffracted beam 100mm away from the slit.

3. Show that the angular Fraunhofer diffraction equation for a single slit of 
   width b is given by

   \begin{equation}
      I\left(\theta\right)=I\left(0\right)\left(\frac{\sin{\left(\frac{kb}{2}\sin{\theta}\right)}}{\frac{kb}{2}\sin{\theta}}\right)^2.
   \end{equation}

4. A plane wave with irradiance of $10 mW/cm^2$ and wavelength $\lambda = 600
   nm$ is incident onto a rectangular slit of dimensions 1mm X 0.2mm. What is
   the peak irradiance 10 m away from the slit?

5. A plane wave of intensity $10 mW/cm^2$ and wavelength $\lambda = 600 nm$ is
   incident onto a rectangular slit of dimensions 1mm X 0.2mm.  A lens with a
   focal length of f=20mm and a diameter of D=10mm is placed immediately after
   the aperture.  Plot the normalized diffraction pattern at the plane z=20mm.
   Create a gray scale image of the plot using Matlab or Python.

6. The [big ugly satellite dishes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ugly_dish)
   have a diameter of 3.5m, an f#=0.38, and operate in the C-band (f=5GHz).
   Notice the f# of a satellite dish is much smaller than most optical lens
   systems.  This is because the dish is parabolic and only operates at a very
   small field of view.  If 100W of power is uniformly illuminated over the
   dish, what is the maximum intensity at the satellite?  Use a distance
   between the satellite dish and the satellite of 36,000km. 

7. A plane wave with wavelength $\lambda = 600 nm$ is incident onto a circular
   aperture of diameter $D = 10 \mu m$ that has a square obscuration in which
   the corners of the square touch the circle ($W=7.07 \mu m$). See
   {numref}`blocked-fig`. A lens of focal length f=10mm is placed immediately
   after the aperture.  What is the intensity pattern on a screen located at
   the focus of the lens? Just plot the normalized pattern.

8. On the web site
   http://laser.physics.sunysb.edu/~thomas/report1/lens_report.html it explains
   that a magnifying glass is used to start a fire.  About halfway down is a
   set of numbers calculating the irradiance of magnifier 1 with specifications
   of f=15cm, D=4.7cm, and incident irradiance of $1 kW/m^2$.  Calculate the
   maximum irradiance at the focal plane of the lens.

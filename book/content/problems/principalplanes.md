# Problem Set 4: Principal Planes

1. You will be designing and analyzing a zoom lens made using perfect lenses.
   Your zoom lens should have a focus range of $7 mm \lt f \lt 26 mm$. Read over the
   design section [on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_lens).  
   
   <ol type="a">
      <li>What are the focal lengths of the 4 lenses?</li>
      <li>Create a plot of the required positions of the two moving lenses as a function of focal length.</li>
   </ol>

2. (See Problem 4.11) An optical system consists of two thin lenses of focal
   lengths F1=100mm, F2=25mm, separated by a distance of d=140mm.

   <ol type="a">
      <li>Calculate the equivalent power of the whole system and the principal planes.</li>
      <li>Sketch the optical system with lenses and principal planes labeled.</li>
      <li>Trace several rays through the system using the principal planes for an object located 833.3mm in front of the first lens.</li>
      <li>Create a plot with 4 different rays traced from the tip of the object (at 833.3mm in front of the first lens). This ray tracing should be done using ABCD matrices.</li>
   </ol>

3. (Problem 4.14) Two positive thin lenses are separated by a distance of 10cm.
   The focal lengths are F1=10cm, F2=20cm. Determine the power of the
   combination and the location of both principal planes.

4. (Problem 4.23 parts a and b only) A thin lens of F=4cm is followed by
   another thin lens of F=2cm. The distance between the lenses is 4cm.  (a)
   Determine the location of both principal planes and the total system power.
   (b) Using the principal planes, determine the image location and
   magnification for an object located 8cm in front of the first lens.

5. The prescription of a Cooke Triplet is

   | Radius     | Thickness | Glass     |
   | ---------- | --------- | --------- |
   | 32.25 mm   | 6 mm      | LASFN31   |
   | 188.25 mm  | 8.1 mm    |           |
   | -144.5 mm  | 1.0 mm    | SF57      |
   | 28.72 mm   | 17.9 mm   |           |
   | 139.6 mm   | 2.5 mm    | LASFN31   |
   | -88.0 mm   |           |           |

   The best method to find the refractive index of the glasses is to use OSLO. 
   The glass can be found in the Schott catalog.  

   <ol type="a">
      <li>Find the effective focal length and principle planes for a Cooke Triplet. Use a wavelength near 488 nm and use the paraxial approximation. Use the thin lens approximation.</li>
      <li>Use OSLO to calculate the actual effective focal length.</li>
   </ol>

6. (Problem 5.12) A positive thin lens (F1=10cm) is followed by a negative thin
   lens (F2=-5cm).  The distance between the two lenses is 2cm.  The first lens
   has a diameter of 1.5cm, and the second lens has a diameter of 1cm.  For an
   object at infinity, determine the following: position and size of the
   entrance and exit pupils, position of the field stop (or nearest
   equivalent), and the paraxial angle (semifield of view).

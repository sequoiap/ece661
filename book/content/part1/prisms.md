## Ray optics

Here's a taste of what ray optics is.

### Uses of prisms

#### Dispersion

Dispersion.
```

$$
    \theta = (n - 1) \phi
$$

This is desperive because the refractive index is a function of wavelength,
i.e. $n(\lambda)$.

#### Beam bending

Beam bending.
```

This is better than a mirror because total internal reflection (TIR) is 
wavelength independent.

#### Retro-reflection

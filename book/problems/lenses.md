# Problem Set 2: Lenses

1. Using the conjugate equation for a single spherical surface,  
   
   \begin{equation}
      \frac{n_2 - n_1}{R} = \frac{n_1}{S_1} + \frac{n_2}{S_2}
   \end{equation}

   derive the conjugate equation for a thin lens,  

   \begin{equation}
      \frac{n_2 - n_1}{n_1} \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right) = \frac{1}{S_1} + \frac{1}{S_2}
   \end{equation}

5. A 4 inch tall object is to be projected onto a screen that is 10 feet away
   from a thin lens.  Design an optical system that consists of a single lens
   that produces an image that is 24 inches tall.  (It doesnâ€™t matter if the
   image is inverted or not.) If the lens has only one surface that is curved
   (the other surface is flat), what is the curvature of the lens if the
   refractive index of the glass is n=1.5?

# Problem Set 6: Radiometry

1. Calculate the optical power emitted by a 5 mm red LED with the following
   specifications. Assume that the LED is a monochromatic source.

   * Luminous intensity: 8000 mcd
   * Viewing angle: 30 degrees
   * Center wavelength: 630 nm

2. Your night light has a luminous flux of 10 lm.  What is the illuminance on
   your optics book located 2 m away from the light in units of lux?  Assume
   that the light has isotropic emission and use a point source approximation.

3. A laser tag system is constructed using a red LED, a silicon photodiode, and
   an amplifier.  The LED and photodiode specifications are at the end of the
   assignment.  The amplifier has a gain of 106 V/A.  What is the voltage
   signal received if the LED and photodetector are separated by 30 m?

4. Table 5.3 in the book states that the illuminance with a full moon is 0.1
   lux.  Using this information calculate the luminance of the moon in units of
   cd/m2.

5. A picture is taken of asphalt outside during the day.  The height of the
   camera is 1 meter and the asphalt is 10 m away.  If the camera has an
   effective focal length of f=50mm, F/2.8, pixel size of $2 \mu m$, and total
   transmission of 80%.  What is the light flux that hits the central CCD
   pixel?  The answer should be in lumens.  Use an illuminance (see Table 5.3)
   of E=104 lux.  Assume that asphalt is a perfect Lambertion reflector with a
   reflectivity of 10% (see
   http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/solarradiation.htm).

6. Problem 5.15.  (Assume that there is a diffuser sheet immediately before the
   slide.  The diffuser sheet takes all of the incident flux and scatters it to
   become Lambertian over an entire hemisphere.  Use a tungsten-halogen lamp
   and calculate the collection angle between the lamp and the diffuser sheet.)
